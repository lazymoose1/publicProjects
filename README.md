# 🏋️‍♂️ Gymnasium Meets Blockchain: Reinforcement Learning + Web3 Projects
# publicProjects
Hello! I am the CEO and Co-founder of a software company but am self taught so here are a few of my "notes". 

Welcome! This open-source repository is a showcase and learning hub for my end-to-end journey combining deep reinforcement learning, world modeling, and smart contract/blockchain development (Ethereum and Solana). The codebase pulls together classic gymnasium projects and modern blockchain innovations to demonstrate how intelligent agents can learn, act, and interact with decentralized systems.

## 🔗 Project Contents

### 🤖 Deep Reinforcement Learning (Gymnasium & PyTorch)
- **DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient):**
  - Continuous control in simulated environments (OpenAI Gymnasium)
  - Actor-critic architectures, target networks, experience replay

- **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization):**
  - On-policy learning with stability tricks for robust training
  - Discrete and continuous action spaces

- **SAC (Soft Actor-Critic):**
  - Off-policy, entropy-regularized for improved exploration
  - PyTorch implementation

- **Evolution Strategies (ES) & Genetic Algorithms:**
  - Black-box optimization for agent policy search
  - Population-based, parallelizable methods

- **Full World Model:**
  - **CNN/RNN Encoder:** Learn state representations from pixels
  - **Controller:** Fully-connected neural controller
  - **Forward Model:** Predicts next latent state and reward

### 💻 Blockchain Development
- **Ethereum Smart Contracts (Solidity):**
  - RL reward tokenization (ERC20, ERC721)
  - On-chain and hybrid world models
  - Contracts designed for secure, auditable agent interactions

- **Solana (Rust):**
  - High-performance, low-latency agent environments
  - Cross-chain RL data feeds and experiment logging

### 📚 Sources & Courses
- [OpenAI Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/)
- [ethereum-blockchain-developer.com](https://ethereum-blockchain-developer.com/)
- Solidity, Rust, PyTorch, and ecosystem libraries
